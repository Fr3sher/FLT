# LoRA Dataset Studio V2

Build, curate, caption and train image datasets from one browser interface. LDS runs on your machine and uses [ai-toolkit](https://github.com/ostris/ai-toolkit) for training and [ComfyUI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI) for local generation and checkpoint testing.

[Install](#setup--install) · [Documentation](docs/README.md) · [Plugins](#plugins) · [Releases](https://github.com/perfectgf/lora-dataset-studio/releases) · [Discord](https://discord.gg/j6hnJBFtXE)

The core and public plugins are free under the [PolyForm Noncommercial license](LICENSE). The core needs no account; optional usage statistics are off by default. External APIs and rented GPUs have their own charges. Additional paid plugins may be offered later.

## What it does

| Area | Capabilities |
|---|---|
| Datasets | Character, Concept and Style workflows; image and ZIP/folder import; subject-aware shot catalogs; local Klein and Krea 2 Edit generation; reference editing and exact retries |
| Image Bank | Review folders in place, score quality, group duplicates and people, search by text or similarity, and build balanced shortlists to promote into datasets |
| Curation | Keep/reject, crop, mirror, rotate, face similarity, composition checks, editable watermark masks, text detection and recoverable cleaning |
| Captioning | Local vision models or JoyCaption, family-appropriate prose or tags, appearance policies, bulk editing, targeted re-captioning and external image/`.txt` round trips |
| Local training | Guided ai-toolkit recipes for Z-Image, SDXL, Krea 2, FLUX.1, FLUX.2 Klein, Anima and Qwen-Image 2.1; queues, advanced settings, checkpoint continuation and experimental slider LoRAs |
| Review and testing | Runs, logs and experiment lineage; fixed-seed checkpoint/strength comparisons, prompt batches, votes, rankings and a generated-image Gallery |
| Files | Standard training ZIPs and sidecars, backup/restore without API keys, ComfyUI deployment, configurable storage and Trash |

Dependencies vary by feature. Bank search ranks matches; it does not guarantee exclusions. Undo covers specific actions, and **Delete rejected** can remove source files after confirmation. Video and slider workflows are experimental. See the [feature reference](docs/guide/features.md), [requirements](docs/guide/requirements.md) and [known limitations](docs/guide/known-limitations.md) for the detailed behavior.

## Plugins

Install optional features from **Plugins → Store**, configure and prepare them in their own settings, and update them through **Plugins → Updates**. Several plugins can be installed together with one LDS restart. Each is independently installable; model downloads, hardware and provider credentials depend on the feature.

| Plugin | What it does | Main requirements |
|---|---|---|
| [API image engines](bundled/api_engines/) | Generate images with Gemini/Nano Banana, ChatGPT or OpenRouter; experimental ChatGPT subscription connection | Provider credentials; API usage is billed by the provider |
| [Camera angles](bundled/camera_angles/) | Create new viewpoints of Gallery or dataset images with controls for direction, height and distance | ComfyUI, Qwen-Image-Edit and Multiple-Angles LoRA |
| [Canvas](bundled/canvas/) | Arrange runs and checkpoints on a visual board, compare or blend LoRAs, generate images and export layouts | ComfyUI for generation; one model family per generation batch |
| [Cloud training](bundled/cloud_training/) | Train image or video models on rented GPUs, monitor runs, recover checkpoints and deliver full Krea 2 models | [vast.ai](https://cloud.vast.ai/?ref_id=683073) account and API key; Hugging Face access for applicable runs |
| [DLSS 5 Neural Rendering](bundled/dlss5/) | Improve a finished video's lighting and materials, compare with the original and export the result | Windows x86-64, NVIDIA driver, compatible model supplied by you and the prepared bridge |
| [Klein Improve](bundled/image_upscale/) | Re-render image detail with instructions, LoRA presets and finishing controls | ComfyUI and Klein models; appearance and color can change |
| [Live channels](bundled/live/) | Continuously render scripted H3 scenes and watch them in a browser or VLC | Compatible local ComfyUI, H3 weights and stream encoder; experimental |
| [Model tools](bundled/model_tools/) | Quantize full models to fp8 or merge weighted LoRAs into a base checkpoint | Python with PyTorch and output disk space; CPU processing, no GPU required |
| [Publish to Civitai](bundled/civitai_publish/) | Upload checkpoints and generated images to a model page | Civitai API key; checkpoints default to drafts, image posts default to publication |
| [Publish to Hugging Face](bundled/hf_publish/) | Export kept images, captions, metadata and a dataset card to the Hub | Write-enabled Hugging Face token; private repository by default and rights confirmation |
| [Resource monitor](bundled/resource_monitor/) | Show CPU, GPU, RAM, VRAM and temperatures, with guarded memory release | No model download |
| [SeedVR2](bundled/seedvr2/) | Restore and upscale images with high-resolution tiling and finishing controls | ComfyUI, SeedVR2 nodes and models; optional TTP nodes for tiling |
| [Video lane](bundled/video/) | Build video datasets from local files or web imports, curate shots, train LoRAs and test H3 generation, continuation and interpolation | Dependencies vary by task: PyAV/ffmpeg, ai-toolkit, ComfyUI and model weights; Video Bank remains beta |
| [Web scraping](bundled/scrape/) | Import selected images or clips from searches and supported gallery URLs into datasets or banks | Source-dependent credentials and permissions; Pexels requires explicit dataset/ML authorization |

API providers apply their own billing and content policies. Model licenses also apply, including MiniMax H3's territory restrictions; check the [video limits](docs/guide/features.md#video-bank-beta--first-release-read-the-limits) before using it. Plugin authors can start with the [SDK and package guide](docs/plugins/README.md).

## Setup & install

**Windows:** download `LoRA-Dataset-Studio-windows.zip` from the [latest release](https://github.com/perfectgf/lora-dataset-studio/releases/latest), extract it into a new folder and run `start.bat`. The launcher prepares Python and opens LDS in your browser.

Complete **Setup**, then create a dataset or install the plugins you need. Importing, organizing and manually captioning images require no GPU or API key.

| Installation | Instructions |
|---|---|
| Git checkout or manual Python environment | [Native installation](docs/guide/installation.md#windows) |
| Docker with an existing or fresh ComfyUI | [Docker guide](docs/guide/docker.md) |
| Docker without a GPU | [API-only setup](docs/guide/installation.md#docker-without-a-gpu) |
| Pinokio | [One-click installation](docs/guide/installation.md#pinokio) |
| Rented RunPod GPU | [RunPod guide](docs/guide/runpod.md) |

**Updates:** ZIP installations use **Update & restart** and retain their datasets, media, settings and history. Git installations follow their configured branch; `v2` is maintained, while `v1` is frozen. Old `main` installations must [migrate to V2](docs/guide/migrate-to-v2.md). Pinokio and Docker use their own [update procedures](docs/guide/installation.md).

### Minimum requirements

The core runs without a GPU. Python 3.10–3.12 supports the local ML extras; the Windows launcher downloads Python 3.12 if needed. Local generation typically needs about 16 GB NVIDIA VRAM; training requirements depend on the family and settings. See the [hardware and dependency tables](docs/guide/requirements.md) before downloading models or renting a GPU.

## Configuration & network access

Use **Settings** for normal configuration. Native installs bind to `127.0.0.1` by default. Read the [security policy](SECURITY.md#the-default-threat-model) before enabling network access; a protected connection also lets you use LDS from a phone or tablet.

Optional usage statistics are off by default. Update checks, requested model downloads, configured providers and scraping can contact external services. The [network and privacy guide](docs/guide/network-access.md) describes these connections, the data shared and public-access settings.

## Roadmap

Planned directions, without release dates:

- Merge Lab: per-block ratios, merge variants, checkpoint merging, fixed-seed comparisons and a one-click Turbo transplant.
- Validate more video training targets with completed runs beyond Wan 2.2.
- Support additional model families.
